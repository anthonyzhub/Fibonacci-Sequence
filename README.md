# Fibonacci-Sequence
Print the ith value of the Fibonacci Sequence by using Rust

## Background

I am currently learning Rust and love to tackle challenges offered by the language's official documentation. This is another one of those challenges for new Rustecans.

The challenged stated to write a program in which the nth value is printed. The nth value is given by the user as input. From there, I chose a for-in loop to reach normally compute the fibonacci sequence until the nth value is met. Each iteration is printed to the console.
